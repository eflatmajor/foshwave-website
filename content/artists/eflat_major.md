Hello there!

I'm creating ambient, electronica, orchestral and experimental music using Dreams for PS4.

My musical background is mostly just piano, which I've played for 25~ years. I've also self-taught myself some music theory over the years.

People often tell me that my music reminds them of Classical- or Romantic-era music, which makes sense as Chopin and Beethoven are two of my main inspirations.

I love practically all music, including rock, metal, ambient, electronica and so on, and I especially enjoy alt. rock, post rock, power metal, folk metal and viking metal.

My favourite bands are MUSE and Ensiferum and my favourite composer is Beethoven.

When I make music on Dreams, I always first start off at the piano. I pick a random key and then I improvise and try to come up with interesting chord progressions.

After having found some nice harmonies, I write the chords down on a piece of paper and head on over to Dreams.

Once on Dreams, I'll generally start with a string instrument (like a violin) or a piano, and start laying down chords or arpeggios.

I generally work on one instrument at a time, from song start to finish, before moving on to another instrument.

The thing I struggle most with is melody, coming up with harmonies is easy for me but melodies not so much.

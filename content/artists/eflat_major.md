## Introduction

Hello there!

I'm creating Ambient, Electronica, Orchestral and Experimental music using Dreams for PS4.

Additionally I designed, developed and administrate the Foshwave website.

## Background

My musical background is mostly just piano, which I've played for 25~ years.

I've also self-taught myself some music theory over the years, which is both useful and interesting.

I wrote my first ever song in August 2014 - a nocturne for piano inspired heavily by [Frédéric Chopin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric_Chopin) and his nocturnes.

After that I stopped making music for a long time - all the way until March 2020, when I bought Dreams.

## My Inspirations

People often tell me that my music reminds them of Classical- or Romantic-era music.

This makes sense as [Chopin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric_Chopin) and [Beethoven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_van_Beethoven) are two of my main inspirations.

I love practically all music, including but not limited to Classical, Romantic, Rock, Metal, Ambient and Electronica.

I especially enjoy Alt. Rock, Post Rock and Power/Folk/Viking Metal but my favourite genres are definitely Classical/Romantic.

My favourite bands are [MUSE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muse_(band)) and [Ensiferum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensiferum) and my favourite composer is [Beethoven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_van_Beethoven).

## My Process

When I make music on Dreams, I always first start off at the piano.

I pick a random key and then I improvise and try to come up with interesting chord progressions.

After having found some nice harmonies, I write the chords down on a piece of paper and head on over to Dreams.

Once on Dreams, I'll generally start with a string instrument (like a violin) or a piano, and start laying down chords or arpeggios.

I generally work on one instrument at a time, from song start to finish, before moving on to another instrument.

The thing I struggle most with is melody, coming up with harmonies is easy for me but melodies not so much.
